# 🖼️ Image Gallery Web App

A responsive Image Gallery built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, UI interaction, and responsive design without using any frameworks.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to design an interactive image gallery where users can view images, open them in full screen, and navigate easily between them.

The application focuses on improving **user experience (UX)** using simple but effective frontend techniques.
